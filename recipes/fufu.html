    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Foofoo is made from cassava, which is also known as yuca. It is a starchy root vegetable, similar to sweet potatoes, russet potatoes, and yams. It can be fried, baked, and prepared just like potatoes; however, it becomes very smooth, doughy, and elastic when made into fufu.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cassava flour</li>
        <li>maize flour</li>
        <li>polenta</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cassava flour, maize flour and polenta with the cup of cold water.</li>
            <li>Bring three cups of water to the boil with the salt.</li>
            <li>Stirring constantly, pour the wet flours into the boiling water. Continue cooking on a medium heat, beating well, for 30 minutes or until you have a thick dough.</li>
            <li>Grease a small bowl with the oil. Scoop a dollop of fufu into the bowl and shake it around to form into a smooth ball. Tip that ball onto a greased serving plate. Repeat this process to use all the fufu.</li>
            <li>Serve the fufu warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
