    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious fruit best served fried. Don't confuse them with bananas though.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 large plantains</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Peel plantains. Cut in half crosswise, then cut each half lengthwise into thin pieces.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry plantains in the hot oil until browned and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
